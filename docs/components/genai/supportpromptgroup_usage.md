## General guidelines

### Do

- Use support prompt group in [generative AI chat](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/genai/generative-AI-chat/).
- Hide previous support prompts once a message is sent in the chat. Once a message is sent, the conversation progresses, and the context changes. As a result, the older support prompts may not be relevant to the user anymore.
- Once support prompt text is sent as a message, follow guidelines for generating a response in [generative AI loading states](https://cloudscape.design/patterns/genai/genai-loading-states/).

### Don't

- Don’t display more than five support prompts at a time to avoid cognitive overload.
- Don't use support prompt group to show selected items from a list, instead use [token group](https://cloudscape.design/components/token-group/).

## Features

- #### Text
	The text in a support prompt can be used in two ways:
	- The text is sent immediately as a [chat bubble](https://cloudscape.design/components/chat-bubble/).
	- The text fills a [prompt input](https://cloudscape.design/components/prompt-input/), and is not sent immediately. Use this option when it is likely that users will want to edit the text before sending it.
- #### Alignment
	- **Vertical** (default) - By default, support prompts are vertically aligned to allow for easy scanning.
		- For example, below incoming chat bubbles.
	- **Horizontal -** In instances where compact prompts would be beneficial, horizontal alignment can be used instead.
		- For example, at the beginning of new chats or with short text.

## Writing guidelines

- Keep labels and descriptions clear and concise.
- Use parallel sentence structure.
- Use sentence case for all text. Don't use title case.
- Use present-tense verbs and active voice wherever possible.
- Don't use "please," "thank you," or Latinisms such as "e.g.," "i.e.," or "etc."

### Component-specific guidelines

- Phrase prompts as either a full question or a request.
	- For example: “List my S3 buckets” or “What is the difference between S3 and EC2?”

## Accessibility guidelines

- Follow the guidelines on alternative text and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) regions for each component.
- Make sure to define ARIA labels aligned with the language context of your application.
- Don't add unnecessary markup for roles and landmarks. Follow the guidelines for each component.
- Provide keyboard functionality to all available content in a logical and predictable order. The flow of information should make sense.

### Component-specific guidelines

- Specify an aria label for the group of support prompts.
- Provide text for every support prompt in the group to ensure all elements have an accessible name.

#### Keyboard interaction

- Focus moves between the support prompts with left, right, up, and down arrow keys.
- Press the enter or space key to select the prompt.
